/**
 * [2180] Count Integers With Even Digit Sum
 *
 * Given a positive integer num, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to num whose digit sums are even.
 * The digit sum of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.
 *  
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: num = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: num = 30
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation:
 * The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
 * 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= num <= 1000
 *
